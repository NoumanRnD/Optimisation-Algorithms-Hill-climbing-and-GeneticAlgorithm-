• From Hash Code 2017, Online Qualification Round: ”Have you ever wondered<br/>
what happens behind the scenes when you watch a YouTube video? As more and
more people watch online videos (and as the size of these videos increases), it is<br/>
critical that video-serving infrastructure is optimized to handle requests reliably
and quickly. This typically involves putting in place cache servers, which store
copies of popular videos. When a user request for a particular video arrives, it can
be handled by a cache server close to the user, rather than by a remote data center<br/>
thousands of kilometers away. Given a description of cache servers, network
endpoints and videos, along with predicted requests for individual videos, decide
which videos to put in which cache server in order to minimize the average waiting
time for all requests.” <br/><br/>
• This project is not ”focusing” on the Google Hash Code contest as such – it is only a
(good) excuse to make you design and implement optimisations algorithms.<br/>

# Please read the problem statement.pdf file for further detail
 
install all dependent libraries of python 
1- install pip3
2- pip3 install numpy
3- pip3 install scipy
4- pip3 install matpolit
5- pip3 install os
similar way all libraries must be configured too with correct python version
